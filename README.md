# algorithms
A collection of homemade implementations of common searching, sorting, and pathfinding algorithms generated from descriptions on the web.

## Notes:
(I developed this circa January 2022)  
Recently (from the time of writing this), I had the realization that I had never paid much attention to these sorts of common algorithms and I decided to rectify that. I simply looked up definitions of the algorithms in text form and translated them into Python code.
